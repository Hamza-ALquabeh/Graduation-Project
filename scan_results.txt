  VULNERABLE:
  Slowloris DOS attack
    State: LIKELY VULNERABLE
    IDs:  CVE:CVE-2007-6750
      Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold
      them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to
      the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves
      the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.

    State: VULNERABLE
      Transport Layer Security (TLS) services that use Diffie-Hellman groups
      of insufficient strength, especially those using one of a few commonly
      shared groups, may be susceptible to passive eavesdropping attacks.

  VULNERABLE:
  SSL POODLE information leak
    State: LIKELY VULNERABLE
    IDs:  BID:70574  CVE:CVE-2014-3566
          The SSL protocol 3.0, as used in OpenSSL through 1.0.1i and other
          products, uses nondeterministic CBC padding, which makes it easier
          for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain cleartext data via a
          padding-oracle attack, aka the "POODLE" issue.
    Disclosure date: 2014-10-14
    Check results:
      TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
